###1.  How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test  then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
 
- around of 2 h
- add screenshot maker(for failure test), add better test reporter, add logger

###2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

- Automation Via Distributed Cloud  - tools like TestComplete, Saucelabs
- AR testing

###3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?

for legacy app if don't have automation yet:
1. choose instrument to automation (based on application, on team knowledge, and etc.)
2. split all app to test modules, and functionality inside modules (use manual documentation if it exist)
3. prioritization
4. development and setup CI

for legacy app if we have some automation:
1. investigate current test coverage (what is covered, what isn't)
2. split all app to test modules, and functionality inside modules (use manual documentation if it exist)
3. create plan of automation 
4. development 

- Have you ever had to do this? - yes

###4. How would you improve the customer experience of the Just Eat website?
(i hope this question about https://www.just-eat.com/)

1. change design of main page, make interactive map instead of list with countries 
2. add header - which contains most popular link (like about us, career and etc.)
3. change investor page - make a list of investors (without loading pdf)

 ###5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
